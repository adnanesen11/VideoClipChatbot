# Progress Tracking

## What Works
1. Core Functionality:
   - Chatbot UI and Node.js/Express backend
   - Document Generation mode
   - AWS Bedrock integration
   - Knowledge Base querying
   - Frame extraction backend (FrameExtractor)
   - Agent, smart routing, and KB modes

2. Document Generation Flow:
   - User request processing
   - KB transcript chunk querying
   - Claude JSON generation with exactly 4 visual steps
   - HTML rendering with frame selection
   - PDF export with validated frames

3. Frame Selection:
   - Strict validation of 4 visual steps
   - Clear progress tracking
   - Frame selection UI
   - Real-time updates
   - Validation feedback
